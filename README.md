# Restaurant Revenue Prediction: Kaggle Competition
This repository contains the solution to my best submission on Kaggle for Restaurant Revenue Prediction competition.

- Final rank on the leaderboard: 193
- Score on public leaderboard: 1676864.38648
- Score on private leaderboard: 1802379.78967

The solution is pretty simple - I use Boruta algorithm to select the features and run Random Forests (tuned with nodesize 7) on the data with the target variable log-transformed.

This was my first Kaggle competition and overall, it has been a great learning experience.
